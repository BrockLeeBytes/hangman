# Hangman

This is a command line hangman game. To play the game just clone this repo, change your terminal's directory to the location of this file on your computer and enter 'ruby lib/hangman.rb' into your terminal without the quotes.

You can enter 'save' in place of a guess to save your game. Only one save at a time.
